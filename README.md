# H-tau-tau
This is an analysis of the Higgs boson decay into two tau leptons, performed using data from the ATLAS experiment at CERN. The final goal of the analysis was
to use a neural network in order to differantiate between the CP-odd and CP-even hypotheses for the Higgs boson, based on the four-momenta of its decay products.
